## Coursework 1
Evaluating Low-level Parallel Programming models[.pdf](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/Courses/F21DP/prac_17_1_10.pdf)

### Description
Computing the sum of Euler totient computation. It is implemented using OpenCL. Comparing against C+MPI.

### Summary
C+MPI provided better results than OpenCL. OpenCL Possibly better for personal use, as C+MPI relies on more expensive utilities.
